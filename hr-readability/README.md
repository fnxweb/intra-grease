HR Readability
==============

If you work for a particular company and have to use an HR information tool
called myselfservice, then this script may be useful.

It only performs two tiny functions:

1. Place the login information on the right-hand side, where convention
   dictates it should be

2. Removes a particularly distressing "hypnotising vicar" picture from the home page.
